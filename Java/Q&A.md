##### _The first letter of .java file must be capitalized?_

There is no requirement in Java that the first letter of a .java file must be capitalized. The naming conventions for .java files are generally the same as for any other type of file, and the first letter can be either uppercase or lowercase.

However, it is common practice in Java to follow a naming convention called "CamelCase" for class names, where the first letter of each word in the name is capitalized. For example, a class name might be "MyClass" or "MyVeryLongClassName". This naming convention helps to make class names more readable and easier to distinguish from other identifiers.

It is also common practice to use all lowercase letters and underscores for the names of package names, such as "com.example.mypackage".

These conventions are not required by the Java language, but they are widely followed in the Java community to improve the readability and consistency of code.

##### What is the variables in java

In Java, there are different types of variables, for example:

String - stores text, such as "Hello". String values are surrounded by double quotes
int - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123
float - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99
char - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes
boolean - stores values with two states: true or false

##### What's data type in java

```java
int myNum = 5;               // Integer (whole number)
float myFloatNum = 5.99f;    // Floating point number
char myLetter = 'D';         // Character
boolean myBool = true;       // Boolean
String myText = "Hello";     // String
```
